## PowerBi Experience
I created this repository to showcase my work with PowerBi.
Despite not having a job title aligned with PowerBi, I have significant experience with PowerBi.
I have created a number of dashboards over my career, however, many of them have confidential information so I am unable to showcase them.
I have remade some dashboards with dummy data to highlight the functionality of them.
I am not going to directly place them on my github, instead, I am going to provide screenshots and detail their actions on this repository.

# Global Warming Dashboard

This dashboard was made to display global data.
I have got data on global warming from Kaggle.

The below image is a screenshots of the front cover of a dashboard.

## Functionality:
## Globe
The globe moves, and is responsive. If you click on a country, it will focus on that country or if you select a continent using the menu on the left it will

## Text
The text below the menu on the left hand side of the dashboard changes as you select different countries, continents or years.

The amount of methane is 995,760.25 in the first image. In the second image you can see the change to 49,209.00 as Europe is selected.

## The Year Slider and Year Bar Chart
The slider and the bar shart allow us to filter out depending on the year. If you want it a year you place to the slider to left or the right. If there are more data points, you are able to sift through them using it.
If you do not want to use the slider, you can use the bar chart by clicking directly on a year.

## The Emissions Per Country Tab
The tab on the right shows the amount of methane per country per year on individual area charts. These charts change when selecting different regions and you are also able to scroll down and find each individual country in that region.

# African Inflation Dashboard

This dashboard was made with data from Kaggle to show the changes of inflation over the years in certain African countries.
